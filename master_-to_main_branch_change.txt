Rename your local master branch into main with the following command:

$ git branch --move master main
There’s no local master branch anymore, because it’s renamed to the main branch.

To let others see the new main branch, you need to push it to the remote. This makes the renamed branch available on the remote.

$ git push --set-upstream origin main
Now we end up with the following state:

$ git branch --all

Your local master branch is gone, as it’s replaced with the main branch. The main branch is present on the remote. However, the old master branch is still present on the remote. Other collaborators will continue to use the master branch as the base of their work, until you make some further changes.

$ git push origin --delete master
